Requirements:

1) allow easy access for user, including write access to data
2) don't read each pixel from disk

ad 1):
- ideally a dictionary would be kept in data
- structure: varName -> numpyArray
- parts of array are filled when requested
- array is deleted when running out of space
- but: possibly user-edited values must not be thrown away
- so set a lock if users edit data

ad 2):
- read variables always in chunks
