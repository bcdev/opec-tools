Requirements:

allow easy access for user, including write access to data:
- data is a dictionary
- structure: varName -> numpyArray
- contains dedicated 'read' and 'clear' methods
    - 'read' reads from disk the given variable data, given by origin or shape (or fully)
    - puts the data into the dictionary, so it can be accessed without the need to be read again
    - 'clear' deletes the local array
- TODO:
    - automatically detect if data has been read already; then, don't read all over again

don't read each pixel from disk:
- read variables always in chunks
- easy with structure described above

Matchup Strategy:
- user can specify a macro pixel size, a maximum geographic delta, a maximum time delta and a maximum depth delta
- for each reference record r from the file, the following is done:
    - in model data, find pixel closest to lat/lon position of r
    - take macro pixel
    - check all pixels of the macro pixel if they are inside the geographic, time and depth bounds
    - if yes: create matchup with reference value from r and model value from the pixel
    - thus: many model values may have the same reference value
    - put all matchups into a list

Benchmarks are computed like this:
- take all matchups
- create two arrays: one contains all reference values, the other all model values
- the same index in the arrays mean that the values belong together
- compute the benchmarks on these arrays
- thus: for each benchmarked variable, a single set of benchmarks (containing one value of RMSD, Bias, ...) is computed

proposed output format:
- CSV containing statistics
- PNG images of target/taylor diagrams
- allow parameter which creates zip from outputs
- example CSV:
