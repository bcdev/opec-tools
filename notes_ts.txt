Requirements:

1) allow easy access for user, including write access to data
2) don't read each pixel from disk

ad 1):
- data is a dictionary
- structure: varName -> numpyArray
- contains dedicated 'read' and 'clear' methods
    - 'read' reads from disk the given variable data, given by origin or shape (or fully)
    - puts the data into the dictionary, so it can be accessed without the need to be read again
    - 'clear' deletes the local array
- TODO:
    - automatically detect if data has been read already; then, don't read all over again

ad 2):
- read variables always in chunks
- easy with structure described above
