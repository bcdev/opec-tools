Requirements:

allow easy access for user, including write access to data:
- data is a dictionary
- structure: varName -> numpyArray
- contains dedicated 'read' and 'clear' methods
    - 'read' reads from disk the given variable data, given by origin or shape (or fully)
    - puts the data into the dictionary, so it can be accessed without the need to be read again
    - 'clear' deletes the local array
- TODO:
    - automatically detect if data has been read already; then, don't read all over again

don't read each pixel from disk:
- read variables always in chunks
- easy with structure described above

proposed output format:
- CSV containing statistics
- PNG images of target/taylor diagrams
- allow parameter which creates zip from outputs
- example CSV:
