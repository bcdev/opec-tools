Requirements:

1) allow easy access for user, including write access to data
2) don't read each pixel from disk

ad 1):
- ideally, data would BE a dictionary
- structure: varName -> numpyArray
- parts of array are filled when requested
- array is deleted when running out of space
- but: possibly user-edited values must not be thrown away
- so set a lock if users edit data
- difference to direct netcdf-access: users can edit
- that is NOT possible on netcdf-arrays in read mode (see test case NetcdfFcadeTest.test_change_variable_values)
ad 2):
- read variables always in chunks

- in Data: method 'variables' needs at least one parameter (var_name)
- then, the full array is returned
- with origin and shape supplied: read with origin and shape
