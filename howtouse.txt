This document describes how to install and use the OPEC Benchmarking Tool
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION

Prerequisites for building:

- Python 3.2 interpreter
- numpy 1.6.2
- scipy 0.11.0
- netCDF4-python 1.0.3dev
- nose 1.2.1
- mako 0.7.3
- matplotlib 1.2.0

This software has been developed and tested on basis of the Windows 64bit-versions of the packages above. The latest
versions of these packages can be obtained from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

After the environment is set up correctly, install the benchmarking tool using:
easy_install opec-0.1-py3.2.egg

RUN IN BATCH MODE

Execute
python -m opec.Main --help
in order to receive instructions on how to run the benchmarking tool in batch mode

RUN IN INTERACTIVE MODE

Open a python console (IPython recommended), and type
import opec.Shell as shell (note that there are multiple ways to achieve this, but this way is recommended)



Note:

- There are no matchups containing NaN
- Consequently, NaN-values will be ignored when statistics are computed
