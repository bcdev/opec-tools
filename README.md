OpEc (Operational Ecology) will use the EUâ€™s Global Monitoring for Environment and Security Marine Service as 
a framework and feed directly into the research and development of innovative global monitoring products or 
applications. This in turn will advise policies such as the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive and 
Common Fisheries Policy, as well as the continued monitoring of climate change and assessments of mitigation 
and adaptation strategies.

The programme will focus on four European regional seas (North-East Atlantic, Baltic, Mediterranean and Black
Seas) and plans to implement a prototype ecological Marine Forecast System, which will include hydrodynamics,
lower and higher trophic levels (plankton to fish) and biological data assimilation.        

Products and services generated by OPEC will provide tools and information for environmental managers, 
policymakers and other related industries, laying the foundations for the next generation of operational 
ecological products and identification of knowledge / data gaps.
